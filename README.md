# Treasury Rate Compare

A friend suggested that the cost ratio of 10yr vs 2yr treasury bonds was a useful way of predicting macro-economic downturns.

This project is me trying to test that suggestion.

When it's live, I'll put the visible code here.

## Assumptions

It's hard to know what defines a healthy economy (no recession) vs an unhealthy economy (recession soon to come).

To make the data easier, I've decided to compare two simple indicators:
1. 10yr vs 2yr historical treasury rates

## Data Sources

The treasury data comes from treasury.gov:
https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/Historic-LongTerm-Rate-Data-Visualization.aspx

The GDP data will come from another source.

## Technology

I'll be using regular web technology (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) along with a web library called Any Chart:
